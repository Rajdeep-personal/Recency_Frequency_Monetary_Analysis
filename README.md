# Recency_Frequency_Monetary_Analysis
Recency, Frequency and Monetary value are three most important things for any retail store to identify and segment customers into different categories.
From the 'purchases.txt' data file I need to build a 6 segment solution based on R, F, M variables and then select the most important segments for the business to act upon along with describing them.
Using R, F, M variables I have to build segments which are more important from the managerial implementation angle by giving scores based on R, F, M and creating a score 
for each customer. After that, I need to segment them by creating 3 groups High/ Medium/ Low for each of the variables R, F and M and then from all possible 27 segments clubbing some of these to form at max 10 segments .
